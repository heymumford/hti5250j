CRITICAL REVIEW: HTI5250J Under Fowler, Sapolsky, Zinsser Standards
=====================================================================

VERDICT: Production-ready architecture (ARCHITECTURE.md, CODING_STANDARDS.md)
          with peripheral documentation that creates confusion.

FINDINGS
========

MAJOR (Credibility Issues)
---------------------------
1. FOWLER MISAPPLICATION
   Location: /docs/fowler/ (all files)
   Problem: Applies Fowler's GenAI patterns (Evals, Agents, Bounded Contexts)
            to deterministic Java code.
   Reality: HTI5250J is deterministic orchestration with timing-sensitive I/O.
            Doesn't need GenAI patterns.
   Fix: Archive to /docs/archive/; maintain ARCHITECTURE.md as source of truth.

2. ANTHROPOMORPHIC LANGUAGE
   Location: /docs/fowler/ (multiple files)
   Problem: Refers to "agent behavior", "semantic memory", "nondeterminism"
            for what is: state machines, data structures, timing variation.
   Impact: Makes it harder to reason clearly about what system actually does.
   Fix: Replace agent/behavior language with technical terms.

3. YAGNI VIOLATION
   Location: /docs/fowler/FOWLER_INTEGRATION_ACTION_PLAN.md
   Problem: Phase 12E-14 proposes 30+ hours of infrastructure (Event Sourcing,
            metrics dashboards, audit trails) with zero current need.
   Impact: Violates Fowler's core principle: don't build for hypothetical scale.
   Fix: Cancel Phase 12E-14. Implement one metric at a time as needs emerge.

4. UNNECESSARY ABSTRACTION
   Location: /docs/fowler/ (EvalScorer interface proposal)
   Problem: Proposes abstract strategy pattern for exactly 3 concrete scorers
            that are unlikely to change.
   Fix: Use WorkflowMetrics record + simple collector function instead.

MEDIUM (Maintenance Risk)
--------------------------
5. DOUBLE DOCUMENTATION DRIFT
   Problem: ARCHITECTURE.md and FOWLER_ARCHITECTURE_REFERENCE.md duplicate
            container diagrams, handler patterns, protocol details.
   Risk: Updates to one version create drift in the other.
   Fix: Single source of truth in ARCHITECTURE.md; archive FOWLER_* files.

MINOR (Prose Quality)
---------------------
6. PASSIVE VOICE ACCUMULATION
   Location: CODING_STANDARDS.md, scattered lines
   Problem: "58 lines removed", "is maintained", "are dispatched" (passive)
   Fix: Prefer active voice; minimal impact on clarity.

7. HEDGING LANGUAGE
   Location: /docs/fowler/ (throughout)
   Problem: "may", "might", "could", "arguably", "in a sense"
   Fix: Replace with direct statements.

8. JARGON DENSITY
   Location: /docs/fowler/ (multiple files)
   Problem: "Bounded Contexts from DDD partition memory into semantic
            boundaries with Aggregates functioning as cohesive clusters..."
   Fix: Break sentences; define unfamiliar terms.

WHAT'S EXCELLENT
================

✅ ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Clear, justified design decisions
   - ADRs properly documented (YAGNI principle respected)
   - C4 model properly applied
   - Handler patterns well-explained

✅ CODING_STANDARDS.md
   - Evidence-based file size targets
   - "Code as Evidence" philosophy is sound
   - Method naming standards are clear
   - Java 21 feature adoption guidelines are practical

✅ Core Design
   - Sealed classes for type safety (justified)
   - Virtual threads for I/O (correct application)
   - Screen buffer architecture (sound)
   - Error handling patterns (mechanism-clear)

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============

IMMEDIATE:
  1. Archive /docs/fowler/ → /docs/archive/
  2. Update ARCHITECTURE.md: change "non-deterministic" to "timing-sensitive"
  3. Remove Phase 12E-14 roadmap from ACTION_PLAN

SHORT-TERM:
  4. Mark Fowler research docs as [RESEARCH] / not architectural guidance
  5. Editorial pass on CODING_STANDARDS.md (active voice)
  6. If metrics become needed, use WorkflowMetrics record (not EvalScorer interface)

LONGER-TERM:
  7. Run real i5 workloads; identify actual pain points
  8. Implement only metrics you actually need
  9. Let architecture needs emerge from production data

DO NOT PUBLISH:
  - /docs/fowler/FOWLER_AI_PATTERNS.md (as architectural guidance)
  - /docs/fowler/FOWLER_INTEGRATION_ACTION_PLAN.md (Phase 12E-14)

DO PUBLISH:
  - ARCHITECTURE.md (with small clarifications)
  - CODING_STANDARDS.md (with prose edits)
  - README.md (as-is)

CREDIBILITY ASSESSMENT
======================

Current: ARCHITECTURE.md + CODING_STANDARDS.md are solid, disciplined work
         that would satisfy Fowler, Sapolsky, Zinsser.

Risk: Peripheral Fowler research docs create impression that core architecture
      is over-engineered or misaligned with Fowler's actual principles.

Solution: Separate "what we built" (solid) from "research we did" (exploratory).
